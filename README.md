# Responsive Website Layout Assignment
---

## Introduction
Welcome to this GitHub repository! This is a small assignment that I created for a job application, where the task was to develop a responsive website layout. I am sharing this project here to document my learnings and track my progress as I improve my web development skills.

## Project Overview
The project includes various features such as a modified scrollbar, animations, and a responsive navbar. However, upon reflection, I recognize that there is redundant code and unnecessary media attributes that need optimization. These are areas I aim to improve in the future.

## Learnings and Insights
Through this project, I have gained valuable experience and insight into web development practices. I have utilized tutorials and external resources to implement different features. This journey has taught me a lot, and I aim to apply best practices and coding standards in this and future projects.

## Future Improvements
As I continue to grow as a developer, I will work on refining the code and improving the structure and efficiency of the project. My goal is to achieve a cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable codebase.
Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out!
